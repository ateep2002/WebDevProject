        <p>
    It's important to keep your balance as you are skiing. Stand tall with your feet shoulder-width apart. Flex your ankles and tilt your shins forward. Keep your shoulders slightly in front of your hips with weight centered over both feet. Hold your poles iwth the tips pointed back, behind your feet. Look toward where you are going, not down at your skis. 
        </p>

        <p>
    To begin skiing, push off with you ski poles. Point your skis downhill and start to glide. Practice gliding and balancing over short distances and on small slopes or inclines. Once you start moving on skis, it's important to learn how to control your speed. This is done by forming a wedge with your skis. It's also called the pizza. This allows you to stop or make turns. Skiings takes a lot of work and practice. It's okay to fall, you just need to get back up and try again!
